## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

This project focuses on **real frontend responsibilities**, including:

- UI state management (selected flavour)
- Event-driven interactions
- Conditional rendering
- Modal-based confirmation flow
- Optimistic UI feedback
- Clean separation of layout and animation layers

> ⚠️ This is a **frontend simulation**.  
> No backend, payments, or database logic is included — by design.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – gradients, transitions, animations  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – DOM manipulation & state handling  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. A default flavour (Caramel) is selected on load  
2. User selects a flavour:
   - Product image updates with animation
   - Background gradient changes accordingly
3. Clicking **Order Now** opens a confirmation modal
4. User confirms order and receives instant feedback

This project was built to practice and demonstrate:
- Realistic frontend UX patterns
